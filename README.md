# What is Arakada?
Arakada regroups all the "arcade" games I've made with the goal of finishing them in one day
So all those games were made in around 2 to 4 hours including textures (buttons, enemies, background etc...)

Currently the games are:
 - Arakada 1: the fruit game
 - Arakada 2: the asteroid game

# Arakada 1: the fruit game
The goal of this game is to dodge bombs falling from the sky while also collecting fruits to increase your score.

You have 3 lives and the fruits and bombs are getting faster with time, so it's more and more difficult to survive

Your highscore is saved in a data file so that you don't lose it even after you close the game, so dw :)

# Arakada 2: the asteroid game
This game is very similar to Arakada 1 but you can move in every direction (in 2D), what wasn't the case in Arakada 1.

You are a lil cute spaceship dropped in the middle of an asteroid highway,

Your goal is to dodge enemies (asteroids, other spaceships etc...) but you've nothing to collect, the score being the timer

You've 3 lives. Again, your highscore is saved in a data file so you don't lose it when you close the game.

I was planning on addind some powerups and more different enemies but I hadn't enough time to do it it 24h. I'll maybe update this game to add those anyways


Enjoy!
